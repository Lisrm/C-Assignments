# List of Programs
The list of Programs are divided into two parts .
- Part-1 consisting of basic C programming. 
- Part-2 consisting of data structures of C programming.

- Find LCM & HCF of two numbers. ❌ 
- To display count of -ve's, +ve's, zeroes in a set of N numbers. ❌ 
- To print Armstrong number within range.❌ 
- To covert decimal number to new base. ❌ 
- To calculate standard deviation of N numbers. ❌ 
- Find decimal equivalent of number(base other than 10). ❌

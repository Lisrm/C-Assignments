## Introduction to C

- C¬†is a **procedural programming language**.
- It was initially developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in the year 1972.
- It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system.
- The main features of the C language include :
  - **low-level memory access**
  - **simple set of keywords**
  - **clean style**<br>
    these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
- Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language
  - Like syntax of **Java**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language.
  - **C++** is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

## List of Programs

The list of Programs are divided into two parts .

- [Part-1 consisting of basic C programming](#part-1).
- [Part-2 consisting of data structures of C programming](#part-2).
